## **Overview**

This week provided deeper insights into reusable and type-safe data handling through generics, collection interfaces and classes, and stream processing. We also explored structured exception handling, pattern matching using regex, unit testing with JUnit, and enhancements introduced in Java 8 such as lambda expressions and functional interfaces.

## **Topics Covered**

### **Day 1: Java Generics**

* Introduction to generics  
* Why use generics?  
* Creating generic classes and methods  
* Bounded type parameters  
* Type inference and wildcard types  

### **Day 2: Collections**

* Overview of Java Collections Framework  
* Interfaces: `List`, `Set`, `Map`, `Queue`  
* Implementations: `ArrayList`, `LinkedList`, `HashSet`, `HashMap`, `PriorityQueue`  
* Iterating over collections  
* Comparator and Comparable interfaces  

### **Day 3: Java IO Streams**

* Introduction to streams (byte and character streams)  
* `FileInputStream`, `FileOutputStream`  
* `BufferedReader`, `BufferedWriter`  
* Object serialization and deserialization  
* Try-with-resources for managing I/O  

### **Day 4: Exceptions**

* What are exceptions?  
* Checked vs. unchecked exceptions  
* Creating custom exceptions  
* `try`, `catch`, `finally`, `throw`, `throws`  
* Best practices in exception handling  

### **Day 5: Regex and JUnit**

* Introduction to Regular Expressions in Java  
* Pattern matching using `Pattern` and `Matcher` classes  
* Basic regex syntax and use cases  
* Introduction to unit testing  
* Writing test cases with JUnit  
* Assertions and test annotations  

### **Day 6: Java 8 Features**

* Lambda expressions  
* Functional interfaces (`Predicate`, `Consumer`, `Function`, etc.)  
* Method references and streams API  
* Default and static methods in interfaces  
* Optional class  

## **Prerequisites**

* Completion of Week 3: Data Structures  
* Comfort with OOP and basic algorithms in Java  
* Java Development Kit (JDK) installed  
* A code editor or IDE like IntelliJ IDEA, Eclipse, or VS Code  

## **How to Use This Repository**

This repository is structured to reflect the topics covered each day. You can find code examples, notes, or exercises within the respective daily folders (if available). Feel free to explore the code, run it, and modify it to deepen your understanding.

## **Next Steps**

In Week 5, we will explore multithreading, JDBC, JavaFX GUI development, and building small projects. Keep practicing and stay consistent!
